The global gaming market is projected to be worth more than $300 billion by 2027, according to Mordor Intelligence. With so much money at stake, the creation of the next big hit is heavily incentivized for major game publishers. However, the question remains: are games improving, or has the golden age of video games already passed?

In this project, video game critic and user scores, along with sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977, will be analyzed. A search for a golden age of video games will be conducted by identifying release years that were favored by users and critics, and the business side of gaming will be explored by examining game sales data.

The search will involve the joining of datasets and the comparison of results using set theory. Data will also be filtered, grouped, and ordered. These skills should be reviewed before attempting this project. Two tables are contained in the database, each limited to 400 rows for this project, but the complete dataset, which includes over 13,000 games, can be found on Kaggle.
